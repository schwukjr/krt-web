I'm Emily Grey, a professional food/product photographer based in West Cumbria. I started my career as a baker at age 13, and transitioned into documenting my work and learning photography. Since age 17 I have worked extensively with Peter Sidwell, a Chef who has been involved in multiple TV shows. Together with another Photographer, Peter and I have produced a cookbook containing 100 recipes, all photographed by myself. I also work with a series of other companies photographing a variety of products.
